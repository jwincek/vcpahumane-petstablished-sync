/**
 * One-time data migration: rename the `pet` post type to `vcps_pet`.
 *
 * Context
 * -------
 * v1.0.0 prefixes the generic `pet` custom post type to `vcps_pet`
 * (WordPress.org collision/rejection risk). The plugin now registers
 * `vcps_pet`, so any rows still stored as `pet` become orphaned until
 * their `post_type` column is updated. Taxonomy term relationships and
 * post meta are keyed by post ID, so they survive the rename untouched —
 * only `wp_posts.post_type` needs changing.
 *
 * This is NOT shipped behavior: a first public release has no prior
 * public version to upgrade from, so the plugin carries no in-line
 * migration. This script exists only to fix pre-1.0.0 dev/local installs
 * (and is excluded from the distributed plugin zip).
 *
 * Usage (from the site root, with the Local socket override — see the
 * plugin/site CLAUDE.md and the local-wpcli-db-socket memory):
 *
 *   wp eval-file \
 *     wp-content/plugins/vcpahumane-pet-sync/migration-scripts/2026-06-23-rename-cpt-pet-to-vcps_pet.php \
 *     --require=/tmp/dbhost.php --skip-themes
 *
 * Idempotent: re-running after a successful migration is a no-op
 * (no rows left with post_type = 'pet'). Pass `--dry-run` style by
 * leaving DRY_RUN=true below to preview the count without writing.
 *
 * @package Petstablished_Sync
