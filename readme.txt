Sync adoptable pets from Petstablished into WordPress with blocks for cards, grids, filters, galleries, favorites, and comparison.

== Description ==

Pet Sync for Petstablished imports your shelter's adoptable animals from the Petstablished platform into WordPress as a custom post type, then gives you a full set of blocks to display and filter them on the front end.

Built on the modern WordPress stack — the Abilities API, Block Bindings, and the Interactivity API — so the front end is reactive (favorites, compare, filters, galleries) with no build step required.

**Features**

* Batched sync with an admin progress UI and optional WP-Cron scheduling.
* Pet blocks: cards, listing grid, slider, filters, gallery, attributes, health, compatibility, comparison, favorites, adoption CTA, and more.
* Adoption call-to-action links to the pet's Petstablished application form, an internal page of your choice, or a downloadable PDF application.
* Taxonomy filtering (species, breed, age, size, gender, color) plus URL-driven compatibility filters (good with dogs/cats/kids, house-trained, etc.).
* Block Bindings connect block attributes to pet data.
* Anonymous favorites and side-by-side comparison that work without a login.
* Toast notifications confirm favorites, comparison, and sharing actions — visible on screen and announced to screen readers.

== External services ==

This plugin connects to the Petstablished public API to import your shelter's adoptable pet listings. This connection is required for the plugin's core function — without it, there are no pets to display.

* **What it does:** retrieves your organization's pet records (name, photos, breed, age, description, and adoption status).
* **What is sent and when:** your Petstablished public API key and pagination parameters are sent to `https://petstablished.com/api/v2/public/pets`. Requests are made only when you click **Sync Now** in the admin, or on the schedule you configure for the automatic sync (WP-Cron). No visitor data and no personal data from your site are ever sent.
* **Where it goes:** Petstablished (petstablished.com).

== Frequently Asked Questions ==

= Do I need a Petstablished account? =

Yes. You need a Petstablished account and a public API key to import your pet listings.

= Does the sync run automatically? =

You can enable automatic syncing on a schedule from the Sync Settings screen. It runs through WP-Cron. You can also sync on demand at any time with the Sync Now button.

= Will syncing delete pets that are no longer in Petstablished? =

Pets that are no longer returned by the Petstablished API are removed on the next sync so your site reflects current availability.

= Is a build step required? =

No. The blocks use the WordPress Interactivity API and ship as ready-to-run source — no compilation needed.
